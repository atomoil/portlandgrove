Hello.

Recently I've been working with a few clients to develop ideas which could become new products and services. Those ideas needs to be shared with others in their organisation, who may not be as technical. We've been using GitHub Pages with Jekyll and markdown as a tool to rapidly prototype sites, which demonstrate these ideas, so we can **show people not tell people**

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn
  </p>

### Sounds good, how do I do this myself?

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) is the best place to start. It's useful, but not essential to [set up Jekyll locally](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/). [This awesome tutorial](http://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages/) talks through setting up Github pages and Jekyll. Finally a theme is important and [this site has loads of themes for Jekyll](http://jekyllthemes.org).
