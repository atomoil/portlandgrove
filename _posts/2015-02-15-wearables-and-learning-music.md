I've been thinking about wearables recently, in particular smart watches. I've also been thinking about people learning to play musical instruments.

It strikes me that if the sensors are good enough, a smart watch might be able to detect how well someone is playing an instrument such as a violin. This could be used to provide useful feedback as to how they are performing, how they can improve and, over time, how much they have improved.
